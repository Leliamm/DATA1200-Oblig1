        <p class="text"> Report of the preparations we did to ensure we would use different semantic tags.

          While planning the website we took into account the fact that people with different disabilities may access
          the website.

          We were especially interested in how colorblind people, people unable to see and people with dyslexia may
          interact with the website.

          In order to account for colorblind people, we showed the website to a person who suffering from colorblindness
          to make sure that

          the website is friendly. Taking into account the feedback we received from a dyslexic person during one of the
          DATA1200 classes,

          we decided to use a very common font so that it would be easier for a dyslexic to read.

          For people who need to use readers, we used different tags like the following semantic tags: </p>
        <div class="card2">
          <div class="text">
            <li> &lt;article&gt; </li>
            <li> &lt;figcaption&gt; </li>
            <li> &lt;figure&gt; </li>
            <li> &lt;footer&gt; </li>
            <li> &lt;header&gt; </li>
            <li> &lt;main&gt; </li>
            <li> &lt;nav&gt; </li>
            <li> &lt;section&gt; </li>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          We used the &lt;article&gt; tag to specify self-contained content.
          The &lt;figcaption&gt; tag defines a caption for a &lt;figcaption&gt; element.
          We used the &lt;figcaption&gt; tag to specify self-contained content, we used it for our photos.
          We used the &lt;footer&gt; tag to inform about where we got our images.
          We used the &lt;header&gt; element to represent a container for our navbar.
          We used the &lt;main&gt; tag to specify the main content of our document.
          The &lt;nav&gt; tag defines our set navigation links.
          The &lt;section&gt; tag defines a section in a document.
          The reason we used the sematic tags we used was because we found that it was the most appropriate for the kind
          of elements we used in this task.
